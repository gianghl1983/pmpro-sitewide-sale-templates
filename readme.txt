Templates for sites using Memberlite and the Sitewide Sale Add On for Paid Memberships Pro

== Description ==

This plugin requires Paid Memberships Pro, Memberlite, and the Sitewide Sale Add On for Paid Memberships Pro to function.

If you are using the default [pmpro_sws] shortcode on your Sitewide Sale's associated Landing Page, you can use this plugin to add the attribute "template" and specify a design from the included layouts.

Included shortcode values for the "template" attribute include: 'gradient', 'neon', 'ocean', or 'photo'.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-sitewide-sale-templates` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the attribute 'template="NAME"' to apply an available template format to your layout.
